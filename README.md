## Features

- **Spotify API Integration** : Retrieves user's _recently played songs_ data from the Spotify API.
- **Automate Login** : Automates Spotify login and token retrieval with Selenium.
- **Data Cleaning** : Clean and prepare data according to schema.
- **Optimized for Analysis** : Stores refined data into a well-organized star schema for optimized querying.
- **Scheduled Batch Processing** : Utilizes airflow to orchestrate pipeline and schedule for every midnight.

## Analysis Metrics

- **KPI** : The key focus is to analyze user's listening trends, particularly emphasizing hourly activity, and to evaluate artist popularity based on play counts.
- **Granularity** : The grain for this project is user-specific song play durations tracked hourly, emphasizing individual days within weekly cycles of the month.

## Batch Processing Architecture

Orchestrated through Apache Airflow, the data pipeline ensures consistent handling of Spotify data by executing tasks, such as extraction and transformation, at interval of every midnight.
